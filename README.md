**Causality Inference on Infant Health Dataset**
- Exploring causal relationships in infant health data using advanced modelling and interactive dashboards.

---

**Project Overview**
- This project investigates causal effects and relationships in infant health metrics, using a publicly available dataset. The aim is to go beyond correlation and uncover causal inference, such as how various prenatal and postnatal factors influence infant outcomes.

---

**Key highlights:**

-Data preprocessing & cleaning
-Causal modelling (e.g., using inverse probability weighting, propensity scores)
-Interactive dashboards for exploratory analysis
-Transparent, reproducible Jupyter Notebooks

---

**Repository Structure**

- dataset/           ← Raw and cleaned data files
- dashboard/         ← Dashboard code & assets (plots, UI)
- Casual_Model.ipynb ← Causal inference model notebook
- IPW.ipynb          ← Inverse probability weighting notebook

---

**Methods & Approach**

- Data Exploration — Visualise distributions, missingness, relationships among features.
- Causal Framework Setup — Define treatment, outcome and confounders; illustrate assumptions.

---

**Model Implementation**

- Propensity score estimation
- Inverse‑Probability‑Weighting (IPW)

---

**Sensitivity/robustness analyses**

- Dashboarding & Visualisation — Interactive plots and summary dashboards to support findings.
- Interpretation & Reporting — What the causal estimates imply in the context of infant health.
